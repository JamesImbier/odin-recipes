# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project ... project!
The idea of this project is to practice my basic HTML. I'm going to do this by creating a main index page with a list of recipes that include links. 
There will be styling done in the future, but it sounds like by the end of this I'll be creating a website that looks like it came straight out of the 80s, or just a bad internet connection that 
couldn't load some CSS.
It looks like links and functionality is going to be the main goal, but maybe I'll get a bit saucy (pun) with some images. 
It sounds easy and I'm beast so let's do it.
