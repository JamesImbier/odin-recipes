                <p class="desc">This dish shares a name with the type of flat, wide noodle that makes up its structure. 
                    Lasagna is an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings 
                    such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, 
                    mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, 
                    oregano and basil.The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after 
                    baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an 
                    oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
                <p class="desc">Feel free to use store bought ragu if you're in a time crunch, but the homemade is worth the work!</p>

                    <ol class="list">
                        <li class="list item">In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well 
                            browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, 
                            basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. 
                            Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                        <li class="list item">Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
                            8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese 
                            with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                        <li class="list item">Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                        <li class="list item">To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
                            noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of 
                            mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup 
                            Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with 
                            foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                        <li class="list item">Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
